Start a new change using the experimental artifact-driven approach.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`, `schemas`, `view`). Once selected, treat `--store <id>` as sticky for the rest of the workflow. Every unscoped example of those commands below is shorthand: before running it, append the flag. For example, run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json --store "<id>"`, not the unscoped form shown below. Other commands do not take the flag. Hints printed by commands already carry the flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root.

**Input**: The user's request should include a change name (kebab-case) OR a description of what they want to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no clear input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Ask the user (open-ended, no preset options):
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Determine the workflow schema**

   This repo's default is the project-local `docs-site-change` schema (`openspec/config.yaml`),
   which has NO specs artifact: proposal → design → tasks. Always omit `--schema`. Never select
   `spec-driven` here, even if asked for "the default workflow"; explain that in this repo the
   built site and its checks are the contract, and a prose spec would be a copy no gate keeps
   honest (see `openspec/config.yaml`, "The Built Site Is the Contract").

3. **Create the change directory**
   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```
   This creates a scaffolded change in the planning home resolved by the CLI.

   **Then, in the same step, write the change metadata (REPO-LOCAL PATCH, mandatory):**
   `openspec validate` rejects a change without spec deltas unless its metadata says so, and
   this schema never produces deltas. Overwrite `<changeRoot>/.openspec.yaml` with:
   ```yaml
   schema: docs-site-change
   created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
   skip_specs: true
   ```
   Do not create a `specs/` directory inside the change, now or later.

   **Declare the enhancement now, not at archive time (REPO-LOCAL PATCH, mandatory when it applies):**
   if the change implements decisions from an entry in the workspace-root `enhancements/` repo,
   write `<changeRoot>/enhancement.yaml` while the entry is still in context:
   ```yaml
   implements:
     - enhancement: "NNNN"
       decisions: [D1, D2]
       resolves: []
   ```
   `enhancements/schema.cue` `#ChangeDeclaration` validates it (`enhancement` is the four-digit id,
   `decisions` are `Dn`, `resolves` are `OQn`). This file is the ONLY link between an OpenSpec change
   and the enhancement it implements: `task enhancements:delivery:log FROM=<change-dir>` reads it at
   archive time, and `task enhancements:delivery:reconcile` reports every change that declared one and
   was never logged. Written later, from an archived change, the context needed to get the decision
   numbers right is gone.

   If the change genuinely implements no enhancement, omit the file entirely. That is a normal and
   valid outcome that needs no note. Never write an empty `implements` list: the schema rejects it.

4. **Show the artifact status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Use the returned `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, and `nextSteps` instead of assuming repo-local paths.

5. **Get instructions for the first artifact**
   The first artifact depends on the schema (e.g., `proposal` for spec-driven).
   Check the status output to find the first artifact with status "ready".
   ```bash
   openspec instructions <first-artifact-id> --change "<name>"
   ```
   This outputs the template and context for creating the first artifact.

6. **STOP and wait for user direction**

**Output**

After completing the steps, summarize:
- Change name and location
- Schema/workflow being used and its artifact sequence
- Current status (0/N artifacts complete)
- The template for the first artifact
- Prompt: "Ready to create the first artifact? Just describe what this change is about and I'll draft it, or ask me to continue."

**Guardrails**
- Do NOT create any artifacts yet - just show the instructions
- Do NOT advance beyond showing the first artifact template
- If the name is invalid (not kebab-case), ask for a valid name
- If a change with that name already exists, suggest continuing that change instead
- Pass --schema if using a non-default workflow
