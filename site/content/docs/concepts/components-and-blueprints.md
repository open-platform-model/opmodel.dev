<!-- Open with OPM as the subject: a component is one deployable part of a module, assembled from resources, traits and blueprints, and OPM derives everything about it (its spec, its matching labels, its names) from what it attaches. A blueprint is the catalog's ready-made bundle for one kind of workload. Scope note for the author: the description says every component needs a blueprint, but only a component carrying the `container` resource does, because that resource declares a required matching key; a component of only ConfigMaps, or of a raw `k8s-*` resource, needs none. Confirm the description with the owner before publishing. Link the glossary entries for component, blueprint, resource, trait and unification on first use. No steps, no field tables.

## In Kubernetes terms

<!-- The nearest idea is choosing a workload kind. The five workload blueprints in the opm catalog (`stateless-workload`, `stateful-workload`, `daemon-workload`, `task-workload`, `scheduled-task-workload`) lead to a Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job or CronJob, through the `core.opmodel.dev/workload-type` value each sets. A component is closer to "one workload and everything around it" (the pod spec, its Service, its autoscaler) written as one value. Where it stops: a blueprint is not a kind, it answers a matching key and the kind follows from which transformer then matches; a component is not an object, since several transformers can each emit objects from it; and unlike a pod template, a component's `spec` accepts only the fields its attached pieces define.

## How it works

### What a component is made of

<!-- `#Component` carries `#resources`, `#traits` and `#blueprints`, each a map keyed by the member's FQN, plus `metadata.name`, an optional `metadata.resourceName` override, and descriptive `metadata.labels` and `metadata.annotations`. Authors do not write the maps by hand: the catalog ships a wrapper per member (`res.#Container`, `tr.#Expose`, `bp.#StatelessWorkload`) and a component embeds the wrappers it wants. Model the snippet on a first-party module: `bp.#StatelessWorkload` plus `tr.#Expose`, with `res.#Volumes` and `tr.#HttpRoute` attached under a condition. Check against: core/src/component.cue, catalog_opm/opm/resources/v1beta1/container.cue (`#Container`), catalog_opm/opm/traits/v1beta1/expose.cue (`#Expose`), modules/apprise/components.cue -->

### The derivation rule

<!-- The centre of the page. Three things are derived, never authored: `spec` is the closed unification of every attached member's spec (`_allFields`); `matchLabels` is exactly the union of every attached member's `matchLabels` (`_matchLabelsFromPrimitives`); and `#names` computes the object name and the DNS names from `metadata.resourceName` and the instance. A component that adds a matching label of its own fails, even when the key is one a member declared. Illustrate with the matching-label union; leave `matchLabels` versus `metadata.labels` to "How matching works". Check against: core/src/component.cue (`_allFields`, `spec`, `_matchLabelsFromPrimitives`, `_matchLabelsAreDerived`, `#names`) -->

### What a blueprint adds

<!-- `#Blueprint` lists `composedResources` and `composedTraits`, declares one spec key that gathers their fields (`statelessWorkload`, `statefulWorkload`, `daemonWorkload`, `taskWorkload`, `scheduledTaskWorkload`), and sets the concrete `core.opmodel.dev/workload-type` value the `container` resource declares required. The catalog's wrapper attaches the blueprint and its composed members, and copies values from the blueprint's key into each member's own key. A blueprint is itself a versioned contract (`opmodel.dev/catalogs/opm/blueprints/stateless-workload@v1beta1`), like a resource or a trait. Check against: core/src/blueprint.cue, catalog_opm/opm/blueprints/v1beta1/stateless_workload.cue (`#StatelessWorkloadBlueprint`, `#StatelessWorkload`), catalog_opm/opm/catalog.cue (`#blueprints`) -->

### The same component with and without a blueprint

<!-- The teaching device: two snippets side by side (the format of the retired v0 page; none of its facts apply). Left: `res.#Container` plus `tr.#Scaling`, with values under `spec.container` and `spec.scaling`. It fails, because nothing answers the container's required key: `matchLabels."core.opmodel.dev/workload-type": field is required but not present`. Right: `bp.#StatelessWorkload` with the same values under `spec: statelessWorkload:`, which renders a Deployment. One sentence on why: the blueprint is where the workload type is answered. Verify the exact error text and path by building the left-hand component with `opm module build`; the recorded text comes from a core pin that uses a different key name. Check against: core/src/platform_and_match_pins.cue (`_failBareContainer`), catalog_opm/opm/resources/v1beta1/container.cue, catalog_opm/opm/blueprints/v1beta1/stateless_workload.cue, modules/apprise/components.cue -->

## Why it is built this way

### Why the spec is computed

<!-- A component that authored its own spec could contradict the schemas of what it attaches; computing it makes the attached members the single source of schema truth. Keeping the members behind `#resources`, `#traits` and `#blueprints` lets the module definition stay closed, so stray fields are still caught. Check against: core/SPEC.md §3.1 Rationale, "Why `spec` is computed via `_allFields` rather than authored" and "Why the spec is hidden behind `#resources` / `#traits` / `#blueprints` rather than flattened at the Component root" -->

### Why a component cannot set its own matching labels

<!-- The measured story: a written rule that catalog fragments must not declare matching labels went unchecked, which is the defect the check corrects. It binds every component because CUE cannot tell a catalog fragment from an author's component, and `close()` did not refuse an extra key when measured, so the check compares sizes. The cost, no inline answer to a required key, was measured against the module fleet first: no module set a matching label by hand. Check against: core/SPEC.md §3.1 Rationale, "Why the derivation is enforced, and why the rule binds every Component rather than only fragments" and "Why the old claim is deleted rather than corrected" -->

### Why the required key survives into the component

<!-- The union embeds each member's labels whole rather than iterating over them, because CUE refuses to iterate a struct holding an unset required field. Any filtered design would have forced the container to drop its required marker, and a component with no workload type would then render as incomplete instead of failing. Check against: core/SPEC.md §3.1 Rationale, "Why the union is a comprehension over the attachment maps and never over the labels"; core/SPEC.md §2.1 Rationale, "Why matching has its own field instead of riding on `metadata.labels`" -->

### Why a blueprint is versioned like a resource

<!-- A module names a blueprint and writes values under its spec key, so a change to the blueprint breaks the module exactly as a change to a resource would. That earns it an `apiVersion` and a contract key. It carries no `fulfilment`, because no transformer can demand a blueprint. Check against: core/SPEC.md §3.3 Rationale, "Why Blueprints are classified as primitives, having previously sat under Constructs" and "Why Blueprints repeat the primitive-metadata shape of `#Resource` and `#Trait`"; core/SPEC.md §3.3 Constraints (`fulfilment`) -->

### Why each field gets one default

<!-- CUE defaults do not layer: two different defaults on one field cancel, and the field fails at render. So a blueprint may set at most one field-level default, the module author writes defaults only in `#config`, and component fields receive plain data. The precedence of author data over blueprint default over transformer fallback falls out of that. Check against: core/SPEC.md §6.1 Definition; core/SPEC.md §6.4 Rationale, "Why exactly one `*` per field" and "Why the author's layer is `#config`" -->

## Common mistakes

### A container needs a workload blueprint

<!-- The misreading: attaching `res.#Container` is enough for a workload. The container declares `core.opmodel.dev/workload-type` required, and only a workload blueprint answers it, so a bare container fails with a missing required field. Check against: catalog_opm/opm/resources/v1beta1/container.cue, core/src/platform_and_match_pins.cue (`_failBareContainer`) -->

### The workload type comes from the blueprint, not from a label you set

<!-- The misreading: write `matchLabels: "core.opmodel.dev/workload-type": "stateless"` on the component. It fails the derivation check (`_matchLabelsAreDerived: conflicting values false and true`). Setting the key under `metadata.labels` changes nothing about matching. Attach the blueprint. Check against: core/src/component.cue (`_matchLabelsAreDerived`), core/src/platform_and_match_pins.cue (`_failInlineAnsweredMatchLabel`) -->

### Values go under the blueprint's key

<!-- With `bp.#StatelessWorkload` attached, values are written under `spec: statelessWorkload:`, for example `spec: statelessWorkload: container: image: ...`; the wrapper copies them into `spec.container` and the other member keys. Verify what an author sees when writing `spec.container` directly beside the blueprint. Check against: catalog_opm/opm/blueprints/v1beta1/stateless_workload.cue (`#StatelessWorkload`), modules/apprise/components.cue -->

### A blueprint covers the workload, not everything around it

<!-- The stateless blueprint composes scaling, restart policy, update strategy, sidecar containers and init containers. Exposure (`tr.#Expose`), routes (`tr.#HttpRoute`) and, for a stateless workload, volumes (`res.#Volumes`) are attached beside it. Check against: catalog_opm/opm/blueprints/v1beta1/stateless_workload.cue (`composedTraits`), catalog_opm/opm/blueprints/v1beta1/stateful_workload.cue (`composedResources`), modules/apprise/components.cue -->

### A component's spec rejects fields nothing attached defines

<!-- `spec` is closed: a field no attached member defines is refused as not allowed. Attach the trait or resource that defines it. Verify the exact error text. Check against: core/src/component.cue (`spec: close(...)`) -->

### Defaults belong in `#config`

<!-- Writing a `*` default directly on a component field the blueprint already defaults makes the two defaults cancel, and the field fails at render with an error that names neither author. Put the default in `#config` and pass data; for a string, interpolate (`"\(#config.x)"`) to force resolution. Check against: core/SPEC.md §6.3 Constraints (L4, L5) -->

## What enforces this

<!-- One line per rule, each with its badge:
- A component adds no matching label of its own: cue (`_matchLabelsAreDerived`), at `cue vet`.
- Two attached members disagreeing on a matching label: cue (conflicting values).
- An unanswered required matching key: cue, under concrete evaluation only (`cue export`, and so at every OPM render); plain `cue vet` and `cue vet -c` pass it. Verify whether `opm module vet` reports it: it validates `#config` and does not render.
- `spec` accepts only the attached members' fields: cue.
- `metadata.resourceName` is a DNS subdomain and satisfies every attached member's name rule: cue (`#ObjectNameType`, `_nameFits`).
- A component no transformer matches: kernel (`UnmatchedComponentsError`).
- A blueprint carries no `fulfilment`: cue (field not allowed).
- A blueprint files under `.../blueprints/<apiVersion>` and its FQN agrees with the catalog's identity: publish (`#CatalogMemberFQNGate` in `opm catalog publish`).
- `composedResources` is non-empty, a trait in `composedTraits` applies to a composed resource, and both lists agree with what the catalog's wrapper attaches: convention. The specification states the first two as unification failures; core/src/blueprint.cue checks none of them.
- One default per field, and author defaults only in `#config`: convention.
