<!-- Open with OPM as the subject: every deployed instance is managed by exactly one of two actors, the `opm` CLI or the OPM operator, and the ModuleInstance's `spec.owner` records which. The page explains what each actor does for the instances it owns, what the other actor does with them, and what that changes when you apply, delete or inspect. Say once, plainly, that no command moves an instance from one owner to the other; describe no transfer. Assumes Modules and instances; links Deletion and pruning and Delete an instance safely for the full deletion story. Check against: cli/README.md (CLI-managed vs operator-managed instances), cli/internal/inventory/ownership.go, opm-operator/api/v1alpha1/moduleinstance_types.go -->

## In Kubernetes terms

<!-- Nearest idea: a Job's `spec.managedBy`, which tells the built-in Job controller to leave that Job to another controller. `spec.owner: cli` works the same way: the operator sees the ModuleInstance and deliberately does nothing but mark it. A second, looser comparison: two tools that both think they manage one Deployment (a Helm release and a GitOps controller) and fight over it; the owner field exists to stop the CLI and the operator doing that. Where it stops: a ModuleInstance exists in both modes and is the record for both actors; a CLI-managed one works with only the CRDs installed and no controller running, and it carries no finalizer, so it is a plain record rather than an object a controller guards. Verify: whether Job `spec.managedBy` is immutable, before contrasting it with `spec.owner`, which carries no validation rule beyond its enum.

## How it works

<!-- One diagram of one ModuleInstance and its two branches. `spec.owner: cli`: the CLI renders, applies as field manager `opm-cli`, prunes and writes `status.inventory`; the operator, if installed, only sets `Ready=Unknown` with reason `ManagedExternally`. `spec.owner: operator` or absent: the CLI writes `spec.module` and `spec.values` and waits; the operator adds its finalizer, renders, applies as field manager `opm-controller`, prunes and writes status. Check against: cli/internal/workflow/apply/apply.go, cli/internal/workflow/apply/thineditor.go, cli/internal/inventory/store.go, cli/internal/kubernetes/labels.go, opm-operator/internal/reconcile/moduleinstance.go, opm-operator/internal/apply/manager.go -->

### How the owner is decided

<!-- `spec.owner` takes `cli` or `operator` and has no default in the CRD. `opm instance apply` and `opm module apply` write `spec.owner: cli` when they create a ModuleInstance and never rewrite an existing owner. A ModuleInstance created any other way (kubectl, a GitOps tool) without the field is operator-managed: the operator and the CLI both treat absent, empty and `operator` the same, and only an explicit `cli` makes the CLI the executor. `opm instance list` shows each instance's owner in its OWNER column. Check against: opm-operator/api/v1alpha1/moduleinstance_types.go, cli/internal/inventory/ownership.go (ResolveOwnership, DisplayOwner), cli/internal/workflow/apply/apply.go (WriteInstanceRecord), cli/internal/cmd/module/apply.go, cli/internal/workflow/query/list.go -->

### A CLI-managed instance

<!-- The CLI is the whole reconciler, once, each time you run it: it renders through the kernel, applies with server-side apply as `opm-cli`, prunes objects the new render dropped (unless `--no-prune`), and records the inventory, the instance uuid and the last-applied digests on the ModuleInstance's status. It needs the CRDs (`opm operator install --crds-only`) but no operator. Before applying it checks that the ModuleInstance CRD exists and has `spec.owner` and `status.inventory`, that the cluster's operator, if any, is not newer than the CLI, and that you may patch `moduleinstances/status` in the namespace. It picks the platform in order: `--platform`, the cluster Platform, then the local default platform; when it fell back to the local default because the cluster has no Platform, a successful apply creates the cluster Platform from that default if none exists yet. Rendered objects carry `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: opm-cli`. Nothing runs between invocations, so changes made to live objects stay until the next apply; `opm instance diff` shows them. Check against: cli/internal/workflow/apply/apply.go (RunClusterGates, GateStatusRBAC call, WriteInstanceRecord), cli/internal/inventory/gates.go, cli/internal/cmd/instance/apply.go, cli/internal/platform/resolve.go, cli/internal/platform/cluster.go (EnsureClusterPlatform), cli/internal/workflow/render/env.go, opm-operator/internal/reconcile/moduleinstance.go (handleCLIOwned) -->

### An operator-managed instance

<!-- The operator adds its `opmodel.dev/cleanup` finalizer, fetches `spec.module.path` at `spec.module.version` from the registry, renders against the cluster Platform, applies as `opm-controller`, prunes only when `spec.prune` is true, reports drift as the `Drifted` condition, and reports failures on `Ready` with reasons such as `ResolutionFailed`, `RenderFailed` and `SkewRefused`. Rendered objects carry `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: opm-controller`. Against it, `opm instance apply` writes only `spec.module` and `spec.values`, restates the existing `spec.owner`, waits for the operator's reconcile (`--timeout`, default 5m) and reports the outcome; it refuses a module that resolved from local files, because the operator can only fetch published modules. Verify: whether the operator corrects drift or only reports it. Check against: opm-operator/internal/reconcile/moduleinstance.go, opm-operator/internal/reconcile/resolution.go, opm-operator/internal/status/conditions.go, opm-operator/internal/apply/drift.go, cli/internal/workflow/apply/thineditor.go, cli/internal/inventory/reconcile.go -->

### Deleting depends on the owner

<!-- The two paths differ, and this is where the wrong assumption loses state. Keep it short and link Deletion and pruning and Delete an instance safely. CLI-managed: `opm instance delete` deletes every tracked object and then the ModuleInstance; because the ModuleInstance has no finalizer, `kubectl delete moduleinstance` removes the only inventory and leaves every object running, and `opm instance delete` then reports the instance as not found. Operator-managed: `opm instance delete` refuses unless the operator is running, deletes the ModuleInstance and waits for the finalizer, which deletes the objects only when `spec.prune` is true; `spec.prune` is false unless someone set it and the CLI never sets it, so by default the objects keep running and the CLI says so. Check against: cli/internal/cmd/instance/delete.go, cli/internal/workflow/query/status.go (ResolveInventory), opm-operator/internal/reconcile/moduleinstance.go (handleDeletion, handleCLIOwned), opm-operator/api/v1alpha1/moduleinstance_types.go -->

## Why it is built this way

<!-- Rationale source: the archived CLI and operator integration design. Rewrite without decision numbers and drop every mention of handing an instance over, which was removed. Check against: enhancements/archive/0006/03-decisions.md -->

### Why both actors share one ModuleInstance

<!-- One record of what is deployed, read by both actors, rather than a CLI store beside the operator's. The CLI writes the inventory itself because a cluster with only the CRDs has no operator to write it. It writes only the status fields it can stand behind (inventory, instance uuid, last-applied digests) and never conditions, which belong to the operator. Check against: cli/internal/inventory/record.go, cli/internal/inventory/store.go, cli/internal/workflow/apply/apply.go (WriteInstanceRecord), opm-operator/internal/reconcile/moduleinstance.go (handleCLIOwned) -->

### Why ownership is an explicit field in the spec

<!-- Without a marker, an operator running in the cluster would reconcile a ModuleInstance the CLI created and fight the CLI over the same objects. `spec.suspend` was not reused because pausing and belonging to the CLI are different intents, and status was not used because spec holds what a user asked for while status can be lost in a backup and restore. Check against: opm-operator/api/v1alpha1/moduleinstance_types.go, enhancements/archive/0006/03-decisions.md (the spec.owner decision) -->

### Why the operator adds no finalizer to a CLI-managed instance

<!-- The finalizer's cleanup deletes the objects in the inventory, and for a CLI-managed instance those belong to the CLI. The owner check runs before the operator registers its finalizer, so a CLI-managed ModuleInstance never carries one. The cost is the deletion hazard described above. Check against: opm-operator/internal/reconcile/moduleinstance.go (owner-skip gate comment) -->

### Why the CLI edits an operator-managed instance instead of refusing

<!-- One `opm instance apply` works against either owner, and only what happens underneath changes. The line sits at execution: the CLI may write the spec, never the objects or the status, so two actors never apply the same objects. The refusal of local module files exists because the operator renders only what it can fetch from a registry. Check against: cli/internal/workflow/apply/thineditor.go, cli/internal/inventory/ownership.go -->

### Why the CLI can render without the cluster's platform

<!-- The CLI reads the cluster Platform when it can, so it renders the way the operator would, and falls back to the local default so that someone who cannot read the cluster-scoped Platform can still apply into their own namespace. Check against: cli/internal/platform/resolve.go, enhancements/archive/0006/03-decisions.md (the platform-source decisions) -->

## Common mistakes

### No command moves an instance between owners

<!-- Misreading: an instance deployed with the CLI can be given to the operator later with an OPM command. Correct: the owner is set when the ModuleInstance is created, and no CLI command changes it. Do not describe editing `spec.owner` by hand: the CRD does not stop it, but OPM supports no such path and its outcome is untested. Check against: cli/README.md, cli/internal/inventory/ownership.go, opm-operator/config/crd/bases/opmodel.dev_moduleinstances.yaml -->

### A ModuleInstance with no owner is operator-managed

<!-- Misreading: a ModuleInstance applied with kubectl and no `spec.owner` is unmanaged, or belongs to whoever created it. Correct: absent or empty means operator; the operator adds its finalizer and reconciles it. Check against: opm-operator/internal/reconcile/moduleinstance.go, cli/internal/inventory/ownership.go -->

### `ManagedExternally` is not a fault

<!-- Misreading: `Ready=Unknown` with reason `ManagedExternally` means the operator failed on the instance. Correct: the operator is recording that it skipped a CLI-managed instance on purpose; the CLI's own record is `status.inventory` and the last-applied fields, which `opm instance status` reads. Check against: opm-operator/internal/status/conditions.go (MarkManagedExternally), cli/internal/workflow/query/status.go -->

### A CLI-managed instance still needs the CRDs

<!-- Misreading: the CLI path needs nothing installed in the cluster. Correct: the CLI records the instance on a ModuleInstance, so the CRDs must be present (`opm operator install --crds-only`); the operator is optional. Check against: cli/internal/inventory/gates.go (GateCRDPresent, GateCRDFieldFloor), cli/internal/cmd/operator/install.go -->

### `spec.prune` is read by the operator only

<!-- Misreading: `spec.prune` controls pruning for every instance. Correct: the operator reads it both when a new render drops objects and when the ModuleInstance is deleted, so an operator-managed instance with `spec.prune` unset leaves dropped objects running. The CLI never reads it for its own apply; it prunes unless run with `--no-prune`, and reads the field only to report what an operator-managed delete will do. Check against: opm-operator/internal/reconcile/moduleinstance.go, cli/internal/cmd/instance/apply.go, cli/internal/cmd/instance/delete.go, cli/internal/inventory/record.go -->

## What enforces this

<!-- Verify with the author how to badge these rules: they are enforced by the CLI's commands and the operator's reconciler, and the badge vocabulary (cue, kernel, publish, convention) has no entry for either. The rules: `spec.owner` accepts only `cli` or `operator` (the CRD enum, checked by the Kubernetes API server); the operator skips a ModuleInstance with `spec.owner: cli` and adds no finalizer to it; `opm instance apply` writes `cli` on create and never rewrites an owner; against an operator-managed instance the CLI writes only the spec and refuses local module files; `opm instance delete` refuses an operator-managed delete while the operator is not running; the CLI refuses to apply when the CRD lacks `spec.owner` or `status.inventory`, or when the cluster's operator is newer than the CLI. Convention, since nothing stops it: never delete a CLI-managed ModuleInstance with kubectl. Check against: opm-operator/config/crd/bases/opmodel.dev_moduleinstances.yaml, opm-operator/internal/reconcile/moduleinstance.go, cli/internal/workflow/apply/apply.go, cli/internal/workflow/apply/thineditor.go, cli/internal/cmd/instance/delete.go, cli/internal/inventory/gates.go, cli/internal/operator/ready.go -->
