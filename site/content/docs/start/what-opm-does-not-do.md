<!-- One sentence saying what the page lists: systems a Helm or Kubernetes user may expect that OPM does not have, one row each. State every absence flatly in the present tense ("OPM has no …"). No forecast, no "yet", no "planned", no roadmap, and no mention of draft enhancements or their numbers anywhere on the page. Rows follow the order a reader meets them: authoring (hooks, workflows), deploying (rollback, handoff, export), platform (provider classes). Add no secrets row; secrets documentation is pending and this page carries no secrets material. Check against: enhancements/0018/03-decisions.md (D3), enhancements/0018/02-design.md (Non-Goals) -->

| System | Nearest Helm or Kubernetes feature | What exists today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lifecycle hooks | <!-- Helm hooks (`helm.sh/hook`: `pre-install`, `post-upgrade`, `pre-delete`) and hook Jobs. Check against: core/src/module.cue --> | <!-- OPM runs nothing before or after an apply, upgrade or delete: a module describes objects, and the CLI and the operator apply them. Say plainly that a container's pre-stop command (`preStopCommand` on the container resource) and the `graceful-shutdown` trait (`terminationGracePeriodSeconds`) are Kubernetes container and pod settings, not OPM hooks. Check against: core/src/module.cue, core/src/transformer.cue, catalog_opm/opm/resources/v1beta1/container.cue, catalog_opm/opm/traits/v1beta1/graceful_shutdown.cue, opm-operator/internal/reconcile/moduleinstance.go --> |
| Workflows | <!-- Ordered multi-step operations, such as a database migration Job that must finish before a Deployment rolls, or Argo Workflows. Check against: core/src/ --> | <!-- A render produces one set of objects and the CLI or the operator applies that set; a module cannot declare steps, order them or wait between them. Verify: whether the CLI or the operator applies objects in a kind order (for example CustomResourceDefinitions and Namespaces first), and if so state it as apply ordering, not as a workflow. Check against: library/opm/kernel/doc.go, cli/internal/workflow/apply/apply.go, opm-operator/internal/reconcile/moduleinstance.go --> |
| Rollback | <!-- `helm rollback` to an earlier release revision. Check against: cli/internal/cmd/instance/ --> | <!-- No command or field returns an instance to an earlier revision. `status.history` on a `ModuleInstance` records past reconcile attempts with their digests, and nothing replays them. To go back, apply the instance again naming the earlier module version or values. Check against: cli/internal/cmd/instance/, opm-operator/api/v1alpha1/common_types.go (`HistoryEntry`), opm-operator/api/v1alpha1/moduleinstance_types.go --> |
| Handoff between the CLI and the operator | <!-- Moving a hand-installed Helm release under a Flux HelmRelease. Check against: opm-operator/api/v1alpha1/moduleinstance_types.go --> | <!-- `spec.owner` is set when an instance is created (`cli` for everything `opm instance apply` creates) and no command changes it in either direction. The operator only acknowledges a `cli` instance. Check against: cli/README.md, cli/internal/inventory/ownership.go, cli/internal/workflow/apply/apply.go, opm-operator/api/v1alpha1/moduleinstance_types.go --> |
| Export to GitOps manifests | <!-- Committing `helm template` output, or generating a Flux `HelmRelease` from a live release, for a GitOps repository. Check against: cli/internal/cmd/instance/build.go --> | <!-- No command writes a deployed instance out as a directory to commit. `opm instance build --split --out-dir <dir>` writes the objects an instance file renders, one file each; that output carries no `ModuleInstance` and no inventory, so nothing prunes it. `opm platform pull` writes the cluster's platform module, not its instances. Check against: cli/internal/cmd/instance/build.go, cli/internal/cmd/platform/pull.go --> |
| Provider classes | <!-- StorageClass or IngressClass: several implementations of one API, chosen per object, with a default. Check against: core/src/resource.cue (`fulfilment`) --> | <!-- A platform allows at most one provider for each provider-fulfilled contract, and a component cannot choose between providers. A second provider is refused: at render (`OverSubscribedContractsError`), by `opm platform check` (over-subscribed), and when the operator judges a second `TransformerRegistration` for the same contract. Check against: core/src/platform.cue (`overSubscribed`), library/opm/errors/oversubscribed.go, cli/internal/cmd/platform/check.go, opm-operator/api/v1alpha1/transformerregistration_types.go --> |
